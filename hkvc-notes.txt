============

TODO1:

Verify if any buffering occurs if lot of packets are recieved on a given channel. 
Because in a given loop I read only 1 packet from a given channel and wait for 
timeout or reception (again read only 1 packet, even if more are there) of data 
on other channels.

And see the impact of the same practically.

NOTE1:

Supports max of 10 MCast channels i.e MCastGroupIP+Port.
It waits for upto 50msecs before timing out wrt each channel being monitored.
So if there are 10 channels being monitored and 9 of them don't have any data
then it will take 450+timeToReadDataFromTheSingleChannelWIthData msecs for 
each packet of data read from the alive channel.

So this will work for monitoring upto 10 channels with activitiy of 1 or 2
packets per second.

However if the data throughput is heavy, then monitor that single channel only 
to avoid lossing data packets due to overflow wrt buffers allocated by kernel
for the channel.
