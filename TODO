LinkedListRange
==================


ShouldBe_CheckOnce
For usages where majority of the time new value ranges that are added are
usually adjacent to one another and also having value ranges which are
non-overlapping and increasing, then ll_add_sorted_startfrom_lastadded is a
almost optimal logic to use, except for the situations where

the new value range to add doesnt belong to the end of the list, but somewhere
towards the begining or middle of the list, in this case, the
startfrom_lastadded will insert these to the location just before the lastadded
node.


Main logic
=============

Should add a Nodes/Ranges of LostPackets remaining in the lostPackets list
still, to the info passed through URAckSeqNum packets.

This will give a rough idea of how many more lost packets are there to be
recovered, in a indirect way.

At a later stage once the iTotalFromRanges is tracked in LinkedListRanges, then
even it should be passed thro to server in these URAckSeqNum Packets. This will
give a very accurate sense of amount of data to be recovered by the clients at
that time.
