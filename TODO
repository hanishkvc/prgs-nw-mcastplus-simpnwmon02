LinkedListRange
==================

	int iRangeTotal;

ShouldBe_CheckOnce
For usages where majority of the time new value ranges that are added are
usually adjacent to one another and also having value ranges which are
non-overlapping and increasing, then ll_add_sorted_startfrom_lastadded is a
almost optimal logic to use, except for the situations where

the new value range to add doesnt belong to the end of the list, but somewhere
towards the begining or middle of the list, in this case, the
startfrom_lastadded will insert these to the location just before the lastadded
node.
